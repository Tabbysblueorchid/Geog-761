# Flood extent mapping and performance improvement using building footprint segmentation
This repository contains the complete source code and necessary files for the technical report on 'A Flood Footprint Map to Guide Advanced Flood Risk Modelling for Emergency Response In Auckland'. The project uses Nelson City, Nelson, to develop the model and assessment. 

## Project Overview
The main objective was to develop a methodology for flood inundation mapping that explicitly addresses errors caused by urban infrastructure (e.g., building double-bounce effects) in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data.
